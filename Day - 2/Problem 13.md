# Task Scheduler

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:

Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

Constraints:

1 <= tasks.length <= 104
tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
0 <= n <= 100
 

## Solution

class Solution 
{
public:

    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        unordered_map<char, int> taskCount;
        for (char task : tasks) {
            taskCount[task]++;
        }
        
        vector<int> frequencies;
        for (auto it = taskCount.begin(); it != taskCount.end(); ++it) {
            frequencies.push_back(it->second);
        }
        sort(frequencies.begin(), frequencies.end(), greater<int>());
        
        int maxFreq = frequencies[0];
        int maxFreqCount = 0;
        for (int freq : frequencies) {
            if (freq == maxFreq) {
                maxFreqCount++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        int partCount = maxFreq - 1;
        int partLength = n - (maxFreqCount - 1);
        int emptySlots = partCount * partLength;
        int availableTasks = tasks.size() - maxFreq * maxFreqCount;
        int idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);
        
        return tasks.size() + idles;
    }
};
